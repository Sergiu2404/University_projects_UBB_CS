Documentation for Supermarket System:

1. Min program file
     - Creates a Supermarket instantation with the products read form file.
     - Generates random bills with GenerateRandomBills().
     - Uses threading to process bills in parallel. For each thread, the number of bills to be processed is split evenly across the threads.
     - After all threads have finished, it performs an integrity check using `Supermarket.CheckEverything()`.

   - ProcessBills():
     - Receives a list of bills and processes them by calling Supermarket.ProcessBill().
     - The method runs inside a thread and prints information about which thread is processing which bill.
   
   - LoadProductsFromFile():
     - Reads product details (name, quantity, price) from a file, returning a list of products

2. Supermarket
   - Tracks product sales and manages bills.
   - Fields:
     - `products`: A list of Product objects, representing the available products in the supermarket.
     - `consumedBills`: A list that stores bills after they have been processed.
     - `money`: The total money accumulated from product sales.
     - `checkMutex`: A mutex used for thread synchronization to ensure that bills are processed without conflicts between threads.
   
   - ProcessBill():
     - This method processes a given bill by deducting product quantities, recording the sold quantities, and adding to the total revenue.
     - A mutex lock is used to ensure that only one thread can modify the supermarket’s state at a time.
   
   - CheckEverything():
     - This method performs a check on the supermarket’s inventory after all bills have been processed.
     - It checks if the sold quantities match, calculates the total money from sold products, and compares it with the recorded money.
     - Prints detailed information about each product: sold, remaining, sold quantity, and money generated.
     - If any inconsistency found between the data, prints data inconsistency.

3. Product
   - This class represents a product in the supermarket.
   - Fields:
     - `Name`: The product name.
     - `Quantity`: The total available quantity.
     - `Price`: The price.
     - `SoldQuantity`: The number of units sold.
   
   - ToString():
     - A string representation of the product.

4. Bill
   - A bill in the supermarket, which contains a list of products.
   
   - GenerateRandomBills():
     - Generates a list of random bills. Each bill has 1 to 5 randomly selected products, and each product has a random quantity between 1 and 5.
     - The method takes the list of products and the number of bills to generate.
